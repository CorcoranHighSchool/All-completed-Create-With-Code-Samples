        <h2>The Art of Scoping</h2>
        <p>In the world of game development, the term 'scoping' refers to defining the size and boundaries of your project. Achieving the right scope is akin to walking a tightrope: veering too ambitious can lead to unfinished projects, whilst a narrow focus might yield less fulfilling results. Here's a guiding light:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Start Simple: Kick off with a core idea and let it take root. You can always branch out later.</li>
            <li>Prioritise Features: Not every brainstormed feature will see the light of day. Channel your energy on the essentials.</li>
            <li>Plan for Time: Allocate more time than you reckon. Those final touches, debugging and refinements can be surprisingly time-consuming.</li>
            <li>Iterative Development: Craft your game in stages. Post each phase, take a step back, review, and adjust your scope if needed.</li>
            <li>Be Ready to Pivot: On occasion, you might find a concept isnâ€™t quite fitting. A change in course is sometimes the very thing your game needs.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Exciting News! When the time comes for your final project, you'll have unhindered access to all the assets we've used throughout the curriculum. From intricate 3D models to riveting soundtracks, everything's at your fingertips. This is your chance to blend creativity with top-tier resources.</p>
